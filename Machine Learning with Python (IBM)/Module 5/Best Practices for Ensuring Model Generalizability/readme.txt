Module 5 Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

Supervised learning evaluation assesses a model's ability to predict outcomes for unseen data, often using a train/test split to estimate performance.

Key metrics for classification evaluation include accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and the F1 score, which balances precision and recall.

Regression model evaluation metrics include MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared, and explained variance to measure prediction accuracy.

Unsupervised learning models are evaluated for pattern quality and consistency using metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Adjusted Rand Index.

Dimensionality reduction evaluation involves Explained Variance Ratio, Reconstruction Error, and Neighborhood Preservation to assess data structure retention.

Model validation, including dividing data into training, validation, and test sets, helps prevent overfitting by tuning hyperparameters carefully.

Cross-validation methods, especially K-fold and stratified cross-validation, support robust model validation without overfitting to test data.

Regularization techniques, such as ridge (L2) and lasso (L1) regression, help prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to linear regression models.

Data leakage occurs when training data includes information unavailable in real-world data, which is preventable by separating data properly and mindful feature selection.

Common modeling pitfalls include misinterpreting feature importance, ignoring class imbalance, and relying excessively on automated processes without causal analysis.

Feature importance assessments should consider redundancy, scale sensitivity, and avoid misinterpretation, as well as inappropriate assumptions about causation.
